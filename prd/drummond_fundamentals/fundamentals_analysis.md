# Drummond Geometry Fundamentals: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Executive Summary

Drummond Geometry represents a sophisticated trading methodology developed over a 50-year period by Canadian trader Charles Drummond, beginning in the 1970s and continuing through 2021[1]. Unlike traditional geometric systems in pure mathematics, Drummond Geometry applies geometric principles to financial market analysis, creating a unique framework for predicting support and resistance levels across multiple timeframes[1][3]. The methodology's core innovation lies in its ability to make the hidden structure of markets visible through the coordination of short-term moving averages, trend lines, and multiple time-period overlays[5]. This approach serves as both a trend-following and congestion-action methodology that leads rather than lags the market, distinguishing it from conventional technical analysis tools[1][5].

## 1. Introduction

The challenge of predicting market movements has occupied traders and analysts for centuries. Traditional technical analysis provides numerous tools for understanding past market behavior, but the critical question remains: how can traders anticipate future support and resistance levels with accuracy? Drummond Geometry emerged as an answer to this question, representing a paradigm shift from reactive to predictive market analysis[1][3]. This comprehensive examination explores the fundamentals of Drummond Geometry, investigating its definition, historical development, mathematical foundations, key concepts, and relationships to other trading methodologies. The analysis draws upon official documentation, academic sources, and technical publications to provide a thorough understanding of this powerful analytical framework.

## 2. Definition and Nature of Drummond Geometry

Drummond Geometry constitutes a comprehensive trading method consisting of a series of technical analysis tools specifically designed to establish support and resistance areas across multiple timeframes[1]. At its essence, the methodology derives its principles from what Charles Drummond termed "market geometry"—the repeating patterns a market leaves in its wake that should be self-similar over whatever timeframe is used to observe them[5]. This concept of self-similarity across timeframes represents one of the methodology's fundamental assumptions: patterns exist on different timeframes with similar characteristics, meaning an ascending triangle on an hourly chart may exhibit the same structural properties as one on a monthly chart[3].

The methodology distinguishes itself from traditional technical analysis through its predictive rather than reactive nature. Where conventional support and resistance analysis looks backward to identify historical levels, Drummond Geometry projects these levels forward, mapping future market activity before it occurs[1][3]. This forward-looking approach utilizes projected charts that anticipate where price action will likely encounter barriers or find support in upcoming trading periods. The system's adaptability allows it to be custom-fitted to any trading style, whether for intraday tick charts, swing trading on daily timeframes, or long-term position trading using monthly and yearly perspectives[1][5].

## 3. Historical Origins and Development

The origins of Drummond Geometry trace back to the 1970s when Charles Drummond, a Canadian trader, began developing his unique approach to market analysis[1]. Over the subsequent five decades, Drummond refined and expanded his methodology, producing an extensive body of work that documented his discoveries and insights. This development period represents one of the longest continuous refinements of a trading methodology by a single individual, spanning from the initial concepts in the 1970s through sophisticated enhancements completed by 2021[1][4].

Charles Drummond's prolific documentation of his methodology resulted in numerous publications that chronicle the evolution of his thinking. His first major work, "How to Make Money in the Futures Market…and lots of it!" appeared in 1978, establishing the foundational concepts[1]. This was followed by "Charles Drummond on Advanced P&L" in 1980 and "The P&L Labs" in 1981, which expanded upon the core principles[1]. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Drummond continued to publish significant works including "The 1-1 Paper" in 1985, "The Energy Paper" in 1991, and "P&L Accumulation/Distribution: Knowing When to Trade" in 1993[1]. His later works explored increasingly sophisticated concepts such as energy flows and pattern recognition, culminating in collaborative projects with Ted Hearne, including "The Lessons," a series of 30 multi-media lessons produced between 1997 and 2001[1][5].

The methodology gained international recognition and has been endorsed by thousands of traders across five continents[4]. Ted Hearne, who collaborated with Drummond in later years, played a crucial role in disseminating and explaining the methodology to a broader audience through articles and educational materials[5]. The system's development represents not merely the creation of new indicators, but rather a fundamental reconceptualization of how markets move and how traders can anticipate those movements through geometric analysis of price action.

## 4. Core Principles and Mathematical Foundations

The mathematical foundation of Drummond Geometry rests upon several core principles that distinguish it from conventional technical analysis. The methodology's philosophical underpinning recognizes markets as extensions of the crowds that trade them, with crowd psychology and energy flows determining price movements[5]. This conceptual framework views market action not as random but as the manifestation of collective energy that moves in wave-like patterns, stopping and reversing at specific areas dictated by larger or smaller energy flows[5].

The methodology's mathematical framework centers on three fundamental categories of tools: short-term moving averages, short-term trend lines, and multiple time-period overlays[1][5]. These elements work in concert to create a comprehensive analytical system that captures both the immediate energy of a market and its longer-term structural characteristics. The integration of these three components allows traders to identify high-probability trading areas where multiple levels of support or resistance converge[1][3].

Central to the mathematical foundation is the concept of time frame coordination. Drummond observed that the same geometric patterns appear across all timeframes, from minute charts to yearly perspectives[5]. The breakthrough insight was that when support or resistance levels from different timeframes align, they create significantly stronger zones than any single timeframe could provide. Research into this coordination principle demonstrated that traders could improve their success ratio by up to three times when they acted on signals where multiple timeframes reinforced each other, compared to relying on a single timeframe alone[5]. This multiplicative effect of timeframe coordination represents perhaps Drummond's most important contribution to technical analysis[5].

The methodology also incorporates the principle that support and resistance can be measured, projected, and predicted[3]. This assumption challenges the notion that markets are entirely random, instead proposing that historical price levels and geometric relationships provide sufficient information to anticipate future barriers and support zones. The system further assumes that price reacts to support and resistance levels following a bottom-up approach, meaning shorter timeframes react first, followed by progressively longer ones[3]. This hierarchical response pattern allows traders to monitor lower timeframes to detect early signals of how price will interact with higher timeframe support and resistance levels.

## 5. Key Concepts and Theoretical Framework

### The PL Dot: The Heart of Drummond Geometry

The most critical element within Drummond Geometry is the PL Dot, where "PL" stands for Point and Line[3][5]. This indicator represents a short-term moving average based on three bars of data that captures the trend and non-trend activity of the timeframe being analyzed[5]. The PL Dot's calculation methodology distinguishes it from conventional moving averages through its unique formula:

**PL Dot = [Avg(H(1),L(1),C(1)) + Avg(H(2),L(2),C(2)) + Avg(H(3),L(3),C(3))] / 3**

Where H represents the high, L represents the low, and C represents the close of each of the last three bars[1][3][5]. This formula creates an "average of averages," first calculating the average of the high, low, and close for each of the previous three periods, then averaging these three results[3]. The resulting value is plotted as a dot or line on the next bar to appear, projecting forward into the immediate future[5].

The PL Dot serves multiple functions within the Drummond framework. It describes market consensus in a mathematical sense, bearing a constant relationship to the immediate past while capturing the recent energy of the hour, day, or other time period[5]. The indicator's behavior provides critical information about market state: it moves in a straight line during trending markets and horizontally during congestion zones[5]. Experience has demonstrated the PL Dot's extraordinary sensitivity to market trendiness, quickly registering both the change from congestion into trend and the recognition of a trend's end[5].

In practical application, the PL Dot acts as a pivotal level for support and resistance. When calculated, a horizontal line corresponding to the dot is drawn and projected forward on the chart to indicate future support or resistance for the next trading period[3]. The significance of a PL Dot level increases with the timeframe on which it appears; a monthly PL Dot represents a much stronger level than a daily or hourly one[3]. The methodology also incorporates the principle of interchangeability: support, once broken, becomes resistance, and vice versa[3].

### Trading Bands and Envelopes

Complementing the PL Dot are trading bands or envelopes that define the outer boundaries of expected price movement[1]. These envelopes consist of three-period displaced moving averages that create upper and lower bands around the market price[1][5]. The envelope system provides visual definition to support and resistance zones, with price action typically oscillating within these boundaries during normal market conditions. Breakouts beyond these envelopes signal significant momentum shifts and often precede major price movements[3].

### Short-Term Drummond Lines

The second essential element of Drummond Geometry involves short-term, two-bar trend lines known simply as "Drummond Lines"[5]. Like the PL Dot, these lines are projected into the future, indicating points of interest on the first upcoming bar that has yet to trade[5]. These Drummond Lines mark areas of energy termination—zones where the market is likely to stop its movement[5]. Multiple lines exist within the system, drawn in various configurations under different market conditions to identify precise support and resistance levels[5].

The two-bar basis of these trend lines reflects Drummond's observation that even very short-term price relationships contain valuable information about where the market will find resistance or support. When these short-term projections combine with the PL Dot and moving average envelopes, they establish near-term support and resistance areas with a high degree of accuracy[5].

### Time Frame Coordination and HTP Zones

The principle of time frame coordination represents the methodology's most sophisticated aspect. Higher Time Period (HTP) support and resistance zones appear as horizontal lines across charts, with zones from the first higher time period shown as thin lines and those from the second higher time period displayed as thicker lines[2]. For example, on a daily chart, weekly HTP zones appear thin while monthly zones appear thick[2]. These HTP lines shift position with each new higher timeframe bar, remaining accurate only for future bars[2].

The mapping follows a hierarchical structure: daily charts display weekly and monthly HTP zones, weekly charts show monthly and quarterly zones, and monthly charts present quarterly and yearly zones[2]. The higher the time period, the more significant its support or resistance zones become[2]. When multiple HTP zones cluster together, they indicate particularly strong support or resistance areas where price is highly likely to react[2].

### Market States and Flow Concept

Drummond Geometry recognizes distinct market states that require different trading approaches. The concept of "flow" is central to the methodology, recognizing that markets move from one extreme to another in a cyclical or wave-like manner[5]. The system categorizes market action into several distinct states based on the relationship between price and the PL Dot line:

**Trending markets** occur when three consecutive candlesticks close above (bullish trend) or below (bearish trend) the PL Dot line[3]. A trend changes direction only when three consecutive candlesticks close in the opposite direction relative to the PL Dot line[3]. For effective trend identification, the PL Dots themselves must move in a straight line in the direction of the trend[3].

**Congestion entrance** occurs when, during a rising trend, the market corrects and closes below the PL Dot line for the first time[3]. This signals the market entering a congestion area, which may be short-lived, long-lived, or lead to a sharp trend reversal[3]. **Congestion action** represents the period between congestion entry and exit, often suggesting a continuation pattern such as pennants, bullish flags, or ascending triangles within the main trend[3]. **Congestion exit** provides a signal to either confirm continuation of the main trend or to add to positions, with aggressive traders using it as an opportunity to increase position size when price moves back above the PL Dot line after brief congestion[3].

**Trend reversal** is formally defined by three consecutive candlesticks closing below the PL Dot line (for bearish reversal from a bullish trend) or above it (for bullish reversal from a bearish trend)[3]. Upon this signal, traders should exit existing positions and potentially reverse their trade direction[3].

### Dot Push and Dot Refresh

Advanced concepts within Drummond Geometry include "dot push" and "dot refresh," which describe movement dynamics relative to the PL Dot[3]. Dot push refers to the market moving away from the PL Dot, often with the dot positioned at the top or bottom of the price bar, literally pushing the market up or down[3]. Dot refresh describes market movement back toward the PL Dot after price has strayed away from it, with specific patterns governing these refresh movements[3].

## 6. Relationship to Other Trading Methodologies and Geometric Systems

Drummond Geometry occupies a unique position in the landscape of technical analysis and trading methodologies. Unlike pure mathematical geometry systems found in academic mathematics—such as Euclidean, hyperbolic, or differential geometry—Drummond Geometry applies geometric principles specifically to market analysis[1][3]. The term "geometry" in this context refers to the repeating patterns and spatial relationships visible on price charts, rather than to abstract mathematical spaces[5].

The methodology shares some surface similarities with conventional technical analysis tools but differs fundamentally in its approach and philosophy. While traditional support and resistance analysis identifies historical levels where price previously reacted, Drummond Geometry projects these levels forward into the future before price reaches them[1][3][5]. This predictive rather than reactive approach distinguishes it from most conventional technical indicators that lag market action.

In its use of moving averages, Drummond Geometry superficially resembles other moving average-based systems. However, the PL Dot's unique calculation as an average of averages, combined with its three-period basis and forward displacement, creates properties distinct from standard moving averages like simple moving averages (SMA) or exponential moving averages (EMA)[1][3][5]. The PL Dot's sensitivity to trend changes exceeds that of longer-period moving averages, while its three-period calculation provides smoother results than a simple three-bar average would produce[5].

The methodology's approach to time frame coordination and multiple time period analysis parallels concepts found in other trading approaches, particularly the top-down analysis common in Elliott Wave Theory[3]. Both methodologies emphasize analyzing larger timeframes first to understand the broader market context before drilling down to shorter timeframes for trade execution[3]. However, Drummond Geometry's systematic approach to overlaying support and resistance from higher timeframes onto lower ones, with specific rules for how these levels interact, represents a more formalized and geometric approach than most other timeframe coordination methods[2][5].

Drummond Geometry incorporates elements that appear in trend-following systems, such as the identification of trending versus ranging markets. However, unlike pure trend-following approaches that typically enter trades after trends are well-established, Drummond Geometry's projected support and resistance levels allow traders to anticipate trend beginnings and endings before they fully manifest[1][5]. This anticipatory capability gives practitioners an edge in capturing trend reversals at favorable entry points.

The concept of energy flows and crowd psychology within Drummond Geometry connects to behavioral finance and market psychology theories[5]. Drummond's observation that crowds exhibit momentum, overshoot targets, and reverse at specific energy-determined areas reflects insights from crowd behavior studies. However, the methodology translates these behavioral observations into specific mathematical formulas and geometric patterns that provide actionable trading signals[5].

The methodology's philosophical foundation—that markets are extensions of crowds and that energy flows determine price movements—shares common ground with Market Profile analysis and auction market theory. Both approaches view markets as information-processing mechanisms where price discovers value through the interaction of buyers and sellers[5]. However, Drummond Geometry's emphasis on geometric patterns and projected support/resistance levels represents a distinct implementation of these concepts.

## 7. Practical Applications and Trading Strategies

The practical application of Drummond Geometry spans multiple timeframes and trading styles, from short-term intraday trading to long-term position trading[1][5]. Swing traders typically focus on daily charts while referencing weekly and monthly timeframes for context[1]. Long-term position traders operate on daily, monthly, quarterly, and yearly charts[1]. Intraday traders utilize 15-minute, hourly, and daily timeframes, while very short-term traders work with one-to-five-minute charts, tick charts, renko charts, and other rapidly changing market visualization tools[1].

The methodology provides specific strategies for different market conditions. For **trend trading**, practitioners wait for three consecutive candlesticks to close above or below the PL Dot line before entering positions in the trend direction[3]. For spotting the strongest trends, traders look for PL Dots that move in a straight line in the direction of the trend[3]. Profit targets can be set using the next PL Dot level or the live PL Dot (next period's projected PL Dot)[5].

**Breakout strategies** involve adding envelopes to the chart and watching for candlesticks that close beyond these boundaries while the market is already trending[3]. A bearish breakout requires the market to be in a bearish trend (minimum three consecutive candlesticks closed below the PL Dot line), a declining PL Dot line with each dot making a new low, and a candlestick closing below the lower envelope[3]. Entry occurs at the close of the triggering candlestick, with stop-loss placed at the highest level of the entry candlestick, and profit targets set using either a fixed risk-reward ratio of 1:2 or a trailing stop approach[3].

The power of Drummond Geometry becomes most apparent in **timeframe coordination strategies**. When daily support aligns with weekly support, or when weekly resistance coincides with monthly resistance, these confluent levels create high-probability trade setups[2][5]. The methodology prescribes acting when multiple timeframe levels reinforce each other while avoiding action when they do not align[5]. This selective approach dramatically improves win rates compared to single-timeframe analysis.

## 8. Statistical Effectiveness and Research

Research into Drummond Geometry's effectiveness has produced statistical evidence supporting the methodology's predictive capabilities[1]. Studies examining the efficiency of Drummond P&L Lines in holding or breaking have shown positive results for predicted support and resistance levels[1]. However, these studies emphasize that individual trader results vary significantly based on skill in recognizing and acting upon the signals the methodology generates[1]. The system provides high-probability setups, but execution quality remains paramount for successful outcomes.

The methodology's track record spans multiple decades and market conditions, with endorsements from thousands of professional traders who have applied it to global markets across five continents[4]. This broad adoption and sustained use over 50 years provides empirical evidence of the methodology's practical utility, even as specific performance statistics vary by user skill level and market conditions.

## 9. Advanced Concepts and Recent Enhancements

The evolution of Drummond Geometry continued beyond its original formulation, with recent enhancements including the 'EOTEM' or 'Pipes' indicators[1]. These advanced tools combine momentum indicators with predicted resistance and support areas, integrating traditional Drummond Geometry elements like trading bands and the PL Dot moving average[1]. The Pipes indicators represent the methodology's ongoing development, incorporating new insights while maintaining fidelity to the core geometric principles established by Charles Drummond.

The concept of **P&L Accumulation/Distribution** addresses the question of when to trade, recognizing that not all support and resistance levels merit action[1]. This advanced concept helps traders distinguish between weak and strong levels, understanding when accumulation or distribution is occurring at key zones. Similarly, the principle of **knowing where the energy is coming from** helps traders assess the quality and sustainability of market moves[1].

**Pattern picking** represents another sophisticated application, teaching practitioners to recognize specific geometric configurations that reliably precede particular market behaviors[1]. This pattern recognition skill develops through experience with the methodology, allowing advanced users to anticipate market action with increasing precision. The ability to predict next week's range and understand how the daily timeframe plays it out exemplifies the methodology's multi-timeframe forecasting capabilities[1].

## 10. Conclusion

Drummond Geometry stands as a comprehensive trading methodology that successfully bridges geometric analysis, mathematical precision, and practical market application. Developed over 50 years by Charles Drummond and continuously refined through 2021, the system provides traders with a structured approach to anticipating support and resistance levels before price reaches them[1][4]. Its core innovation lies in the coordination of multiple timeframes, allowing traders to identify high-probability trading zones where support or resistance from different time periods align[2][5].

The methodology's mathematical foundation, centered on the PL Dot moving average and short-term Drummond Lines, creates a framework that is both theoretically sound and practically applicable[1][3][5]. By recognizing markets as extensions of crowd behavior and viewing price movement through the lens of energy flows and geometric patterns, Drummond Geometry offers practitioners a unique perspective on market structure[5]. This perspective, combined with the system's projective capabilities, allows traders to lead rather than lag the market—a rare achievement in technical analysis.

The relationship between Drummond Geometry and other trading methodologies reveals it as a distinct approach that borrows elements from various schools of thought while synthesizing them into an integrated whole. Its emphasis on time frame coordination, projected support and resistance, and the geometric analysis of price patterns creates a methodology that stands apart from conventional technical analysis[1][2][3][5]. The system's adaptability to any timeframe and trading style, from tick charts to yearly perspectives, demonstrates its fundamental soundness and versatility.

For traders willing to invest the time to master its principles and develop the skill to recognize its signals, Drummond Geometry offers a powerful analytical framework capable of improving trading results significantly. The methodology's 50-year development period, extensive documentation, and global endorsement by thousands of practitioners testify to its practical value[1][4]. As markets continue to evolve, the geometric principles underlying this methodology remain relevant, providing a stable foundation for understanding the hidden structures that govern price movement.
