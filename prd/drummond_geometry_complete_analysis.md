# Drummond Geometry: A Complete Deep Dive Analysis

## Executive Summary

Drummond Geometry is a comprehensive technical analysis methodology developed by Charles Drummond over a 50-year period, beginning in the 1970s. It is designed to predict future support and resistance levels by applying geometric principles to market price action, making the hidden structure of markets visible. Unlike traditional, lagging indicators, Drummond Geometry is a forward-looking system that projects key levels into the future. The methodology is built on three core pillars: the PLdot (a unique 3-period moving average), short-term trendlines, and, most importantly, the coordination of analysis across multiple timeframes. This multi-timeframe approach can significantly increase the probability of identifying successful trades by aligning support and resistance zones from different perspectives (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).

The system is versatile, applicable to any liquid market (forex, stocks, commodities) and any trading style, from long-term position trading to intraday scalping. The core of the methodology involves identifying five distinct market states—trend, congestion entrance, congestion action, congestion exit, and trend reversal—which provides traders with a clear framework for decision-making. While the learning curve is steep and requires significant dedication, testimonials from a global user base attest to its effectiveness in improving trade timing, risk management, and overall profitability. The methodology is available through official, premium-priced software and a robust educational course, as well as more accessible, community-developed indicators on platforms like TradingView.

## 1. What is Drummond Geometry?

Drummond Geometry is a trading methodology that consists of a series of technical analysis tools designed to establish and project support and resistance areas across multiple timeframes. It was developed by Charles Drummond, a Canadian trader, who began his work in the 1970s and continued to refine it over the next five decades. The name "Geometry" refers not to pure mathematics, but to the repeating patterns and spatial relationships that market prices create on a chart.

The fundamental premise of the methodology is that market movements are not random but are instead an extension of crowd psychology and energy flows. These flows create geometric patterns that are self-similar across all timeframes, meaning a pattern on a 5-minute chart has similar structural properties to one on a monthly chart. The core innovation of Drummond Geometry is its ability to project future support and resistance zones before the market reaches them, giving traders an anticipatory edge rather than a reactive one.

### Historical Development

The methodology's development is one of the longest continuous refinements of a trading system by a single individual. Charles Drummond's journey began in the 1970s, leading to a series of publications that documented his evolving insights:

-   **1978:** *How to Make Money in the Futures Market…and lots of it!* - The foundational work.
-   **1980s:** *Charles Drummond on Advanced P&L* (1980), *The P&L Labs* (1981), and *The 1-1 Paper* (1985) expanded on the core concepts.
-   **1990s:** *The Energy Paper* (1991), *P&L Accumulation/Distribution* (1993), and *Psycho Paper '96* introduced more sophisticated concepts around market energy, timing, and trader psychology.
-   **1997-2001:** Collaboration with Ted Hearne produced "The Lessons," a series of 30 multi-media lessons that made the complex methodology more accessible to a wider audience.

Over its 50-year history, Drummond Geometry has been adopted by thousands of traders globally, a testament to its perceived utility and effectiveness in navigating complex financial markets.

## 2. Core Principles & Mathematical Foundations

The theoretical framework of Drummond Geometry is built on a distinct philosophy of market behavior, combined with a unique mathematical approach.

### Philosophical Underpinnings

The methodology rests on the idea that markets are an extension of the crowds that trade them. Therefore, crowd psychology, momentum, and energy flows are the primary drivers of price movement. Drummond conceptualized this market energy as moving in wave-like patterns that stop and reverse at predictable areas dictated by the convergence of larger and smaller energy flows. The system aims to measure these flows and project where this energy will terminate.

### Fundamental Assumptions

The application of Drummond Geometry is based on several key assumptions:

1.  **Patterns Recur:** Charts exhibit identifiable patterns that repeat over time.
2.  **Self-Similarity Across Timeframes:** These patterns are fractal in nature, appearing with similar characteristics on all timeframes, from tick charts to yearly charts.
3.  **Support and Resistance Can Be Predicted:** It is possible to measure, project, and predict future support and resistance levels with a reasonable degree of accuracy.
4.  **Hierarchical Market Reaction:** Price reacts to support and resistance in a bottom-up fashion; shorter timeframes react first, providing early clues about how price will behave at more significant, longer-term levels.

### The Three Pillars of Analysis

The mathematical foundation of the methodology is built on three integrated categories of tools:

1.  **Short-Term Moving Averages:** The cornerstone is the **PLdot**, a specialized three-bar moving average, which is complemented by an **Envelope system** that defines the expected range of price movement.
2.  **Short-Term Trend Lines:** These are simple two-bar trend lines, known as **Drummond Lines**, which are projected forward to identify near-term points of energy termination (support or resistance).
3.  **Multiple Time-Period Overlays:** This is arguably Drummond's most significant contribution. The principle dictates that when support or resistance levels from different timeframes (e.g., daily, weekly, and monthly) converge, they create a much stronger, higher-probability zone for a market reaction. Research has suggested that trading on these aligned signals can improve success ratios by up to three times compared to single-timeframe analysis.

### The PLdot: The Heart of the System

Central to the entire methodology is the **PLdot** (Point and Line). It is not a standard moving average but an "average of averages" designed to be exceptionally sensitive to changes in market trend and state.

**The Formula:**
The PLdot is calculated by first finding the average of the High, Low, and Close for each of the last three price bars. These three averages are then averaged together.

> **PLdot = [Avg(H₁, L₁, C₁) + Avg(H₂, L₂, C₂) + Avg(H₃, L₃, C₃)] / 3**

The resulting value is then plotted *forward* on the next bar to appear, making it a leading, or projective, indicator. The PLdot serves to define the market's consensus value; its slope indicates the trend, while its horizontal movement signals a congestion phase. Its forward-looking nature is what fundamentally separates it from conventional, lagging moving averages.

## 3. How Drummond Geometry Works

The mechanics of Drummond Geometry involve a step-by-step process of setting up charts, performing calculations, and interpreting the results within a multi-timeframe framework. This process allows traders to identify the market's current state and anticipate its next move.

### Step 1: Establish the Timeframe Structure

The analysis always begins by setting up a three-tiered timeframe structure tailored to the trader's objective:

-   **Higher Timeframe (HTF):** Provides the broad market context and identifies the most significant support and resistance zones. (e.g., Weekly chart for a swing trader).
-   **Focus Timeframe:** The primary chart where trades are analyzed and executed. (e.g., Daily chart for a swing trader).
-   **Lower Timeframe (LTF):** Used for monitoring price action at key decision points identified on the higher timeframes, allowing for precise entry and exit timing. (e.g., Hourly chart for a swing trader).

### Step 2: Calculate and Plot the Core Indicators

On each timeframe, the core components are plotted:

-   **The PLdot:** Calculated for each completed bar and projected onto the next bar. The slope of the PLdot line is critical: a rising slope indicates an uptrend, a falling slope indicates a downtrend, and a horizontal line indicates congestion.
-   **The Envelope System:** Two bands are plotted around the PLdot, typically based on a 3-period moving average. They are not meant to contain all price action but to provide a matrix for measuring market energy. In congestion, price tends to oscillate between the envelope bands. In a strong trend, price will often "push" outside the envelope, a pattern known as a "C-wave."
-   **Drummond Lines:** Various short-term, two-bar trendlines are drawn and projected forward to pinpoint potential termination points for price swings.

![Figure 1: PLdot Calculation Methodology](docs/drummond_mechanics/pldot_calculation.png)

*Figure 1 illustrates the process of averaging the high, low, and close for three consecutive bars to derive the final PLdot value, which is then projected forward.*

### Step 3: Identify the Five Market States

With the indicators plotted, the trader identifies the current market state based on a set of clear, unambiguous rules concerning the price's relationship to the PLdot line:

1.  **Trend Trading:** Confirmed when three consecutive price bars close on the same side of the PLdot (e.g., three closes above the PLdot confirms an uptrend).
2.  **Congestion Entrance:** Signaled by the *first* bar that closes on the opposite side of the PLdot after a confirmed trend. This indicates the trend has paused.
3.  **Congestion Action:** The period where price closes on alternating sides of the PLdot without establishing a new three-bar trend. The PLdot line will typically be horizontal.
4.  **Congestion Exit:** A signal that the market is resuming its original trend, often providing an opportunity to add to a position.
5.  **Trend Reversal:** Confirmed when three consecutive bars close on the opposite side of the PLdot from the prior trend, signaling a formal change in direction.

![Figure 4: The Five Types of Trading](docs/drummond_mechanics/trading_types.png)

*Figure 4 provides a visual guide to how a market progresses through these distinct phases, moving from a trend into congestion and then potentially into a reversal.*

### Step 4: Coordinate Across Timeframes

This is the most critical step. Support and resistance zones identified on the Higher Timeframe (e.g., weekly PLdot, weekly envelope bands) are overlaid onto the Focus Timeframe (e.g., daily chart). 

-   **High-Probability Zones:** When a support or resistance level on the Focus Timeframe *aligns with* a level from the Higher Timeframe, it creates a reinforced, high-probability zone where the market is highly likely to react.
-   **Low-Probability Zones:** Levels on the Focus Timeframe that do not have corresponding confirmation from the HTF are considered weaker and more likely to break.

![Figure 3: Multiple Timeframe Coordination](docs/drummond_mechanics/timeframe_coordination.png)

*Figure 3 demonstrates how monthly and weekly support/resistance zones are overlaid on a daily chart, creating clear areas of confluent energy.*

### Step 5: Trade Execution and Management

Trades are executed at these high-probability, timeframe-coordinated zones. Using the Lower Timeframe, the trader monitors for the precise moment the market confirms it is respecting the zone before entering a trade. Stop-loss orders are placed just beyond the zone, and profit targets are typically set at the next opposing zone of resistance or support.

## 4. Practical Applications

Drummond Geometry's adaptability makes it suitable for a wide range of real-world trading applications.

### Swing Trading
This is one of the most popular applications. Using a daily focus chart, a weekly context chart, and an hourly monitoring chart, swing traders can effectively identify the tops and bottoms of multi-day price swings. They wait for daily price to retrace to a pre-identified weekly support or resistance zone and then use the hourly chart to time their entry, capturing the bulk of the weekly price move.

### Position Trading and Long-Term Forecasting
For long-term investors, the methodology can be applied to monthly, quarterly, and yearly charts. This allows for the forecasting of major market turning points months in advance. A real-world example cited in the research is the analysis of the S&P 500 in 2002. By identifying a developing "C-wave" (a strong trend) on the yearly chart and seeing how resistance held on the monthly and weekly charts, practitioners were able to anticipate the major decline of that year, with projected targets between 600-700 on the S&P index.

### Forex and 24-Hour Markets
The 24-hour nature and high liquidity of the forex market make it an ideal environment for Drummond Geometry. Breakout strategies are particularly effective. For example, a trader can identify a currency pair in a strong trend on a 4-hour chart, confirmed by a sloping PLdot. A breakout is signaled when a candlestick closes outside the envelope in the direction of the trend. The entry occurs at the close of this breakout bar, with a tight stop-loss, allowing the trader to ride the subsequent momentum.

### Day Trading
Day traders can apply the same principles to much shorter timeframes (e.g., 15-minute, 5-minute, and 1-minute charts). The forward-looking nature of the tool means day traders know the key intraday support and resistance levels in advance. They can position themselves at these levels with tight stops, anticipating bounces or rejections, rather than reacting to price moves after they have already occurred.

## 5. Common Patterns & Configurations

Through experience, practitioners learn to recognize several recurring patterns that signal high-probability trading opportunities.

-   **The PLdot Push:** Occurs in a strong trend where the PLdot develops a smooth, consistent slope and appears to "push" the price along. Retracements are shallow, typically only returning to the PLdot level itself, signaling a very strong and durable trend.
-   **The PLdot Refresh:** Describes the tendency of price to return, or "refresh," back to the PLdot after it has moved a significant distance away from it. This pattern is useful for setting profit targets or identifying entry points during pullbacks.
-   **The Exhaust Pattern:** An exhaust happens when a market move extends far beyond its envelope, runs out of energy, and then sharply reverses back toward the PLdot. These patterns signal a depletion of momentum and often mark significant short-term turning points.
-   **The C-Wave Pattern:** A sign of exceptional trend strength. It occurs when the envelope boundary itself moves in the direction of the trend, with price consistently closing at or beyond it. A C-wave on a high timeframe, like a weekly or monthly chart, indicates a very powerful and sustained move.
-   **Congestion Oscillation:** In a congestion phase, price tends to oscillate predictably between the upper and lower envelope boundaries. This allows for range-trading strategies, buying at the lower support boundary and selling at the upper resistance boundary until the pattern resolves with a breakout or reversal.

![Figure 2: Envelope System Behavior](docs/drummond_mechanics/envelope_system.png)

*Figure 2 visually contrasts how the envelope acts as a boundary in congestion markets versus how it acts as a propellant in trending markets (the C-Wave).*

## 8. Limitations & Considerations

While powerful, Drummond Geometry is not without its limitations and challenges, which every prospective user must consider.

### The Steep Learning Curve

This is the most significant barrier to entry. The official course requires 60-180 hours of initial study, and true mastery can take 6-18 months of dedicated practice. The complexity of multi-timeframe analysis and the sheer volume of a 50-year methodology can be overwhelming. Many traders abandon the effort before achieving proficiency.

### Skill-Dependent Results

This is not a mechanical, "black box" system. Its effectiveness is highly dependent on the trader's skill in interpreting patterns, judging setup quality, and executing trades. User testimonials show that those who commit to the learning process report outstanding results, but success is not guaranteed and varies widely.

### High Cost of Entry

The ~$5,000 upfront cost for the official course and software is a substantial investment, creating a significant barrier for undercapitalized or part-time traders. While the potential return on investment is high, the initial financial risk is a major consideration.

### Proprietary and Closed Nature

The methodology's advanced concepts are protected by non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). This limits open discussion, community collaboration, and independent verification, which can be a drawback compared to open-source trading concepts. It also creates a dependency on the official source for all authoritative knowledge.

### Tool and Platform Limitations

The best tools are restricted to a few specific platforms (TradeStation, MultiCharts, NinjaTrader). Users of other platforms must rely on less-featured community indicators. Furthermore, the lack of a dedicated programming library makes it challenging for algorithmic traders to build and backtest strategies systematically.
## 9. Recommendations

Based on this comprehensive analysis, the following recommendations are provided for traders considering the adoption of Drummond Geometry.

**For New Traders (<$25,000 account):**

-   **Rationale:** Day trading requires maximum efficiency. The advanced automation and alert features of the premium tools are essential for identifying setups across multiple markets without having to monitor each chart manually.

**For Algorithmic and Quantitative Traders:**
-   **Recommendation:** **Acquire the full educational course first.** Before attempting to automate, you must deeply understand the discretionary rules and nuances of the methodology. 
-   **Rationale:** There are no off-the-shelf APIs. You will need to build your models from scratch, and a thorough understanding of the theory is essential to avoid critical implementation errors. Be prepared for a significant time investment in both learning and development.

## 10. Conclusion

Drummond Geometry stands as a uniquely comprehensive and enduring technical analysis methodology. Its 50-year development has produced a sophisticated, forward-looking system that offers a clear, structured framework for understanding and trading the markets. By focusing on the projection of future support and resistance and the critical coordination of multiple timeframes, it provides practitioners with a distinct analytical edge over conventional, lagging indicators.

The heart of the system—the PLdot, the envelope system, and the five defined market states—gives traders an unambiguous lens through which to view market action. It provides a roadmap for anticipating whether a market will continue to trend, enter a period of congestion, or reverse entirely. The common patterns, such as the PLdot Push, Exhausts, and C-Waves, offer recognizable, high-probability setups for those who have invested the time to learn them.

However, the power of Drummond Geometry is matched by its significant demands. The steep learning curve, the substantial financial cost of the official tools and education, and the high degree of skill required for successful application mean it is not a path for the casual trader. Success is not guaranteed by the purchase of software but is earned through months of dedicated study, practice, and disciplined application.

The available tools reflect this dichotomy. Free and low-cost indicators on platforms like TradingView have made the basic concepts more accessible than ever, providing a vital entry point for exploration. Yet, the full power of the methodology remains locked within the premium-priced official suite, which offers automation and analytical depth that free tools cannot match.

For the serious trader willing to make the commitment, Drummond Geometry offers the potential for a profound shift in market perspective—from reacting to past price action to anticipating future market structure. It is a complete methodology that, when mastered, provides a reliable and adaptable set of skills for a lifetime of trading.
